## General Overview 
This Java program basically implements a key-value database to aid with performing transactions. The core functionalities of this program include: get, put, begin transaction, commit, and rollback. For my implementation, I utilized HashMaps to serve a the data structures. 

## Setup/Preparation
Since this is a simple Java program, it does not require any prior setup or modifications besides installing Java. Alternative options for running this program include running on online development environments which require no installations. 

## Running/Testing Functionality
Once you have downloaded the file, ensure it is saved as Main.java. Then proceed to run the code, and the Main method will follow through with the tests that have already been included in it. These tests were imported into the Main method from the assignment requirements docs. To test additional test cases, simply add the commands in the main method and ensure you include print statements to show the outputs. In the case you are testing for errors, include try/catch blocks as I have to account for these errors. Not doing so would result in the program terminating the moment the first error is found.
